# minmap
I would like to share my personal script that I use during CTFs. Scanning all ports with nmap may take a long time to produce an output. This script might be useful for quickly scanning all ports.

# Usage

```@zsh
git clone https://github.com/sudosuraj/minmap.git
cd minmap
chmod +x minmap.sh
```
add this alias so you can run this script easily:
```@zsh
echo alias minmap='sudo /path/to/minmap.sh'
```
